- See latest commits on **[github.com/ShadowProject](https://github.com/shadowproject/shadow)**

## GET INVOLVED

Shadow is an **Open Source project** which is created almost entirely by **volunteers**. There are lots of ways you can get involved and help the project grow and improve. Here are some ways for you to get started!

### **Know how to code? Help us!**

The Shadow project is hosted over on **[GitHub](https://github.com/ShadowProject/)**. This is where our developers work hard on the next version(s) of the software. To get involved with developing Shadow, check out our detailed contributing guidelines. We credit all contributors to the Shadow project in every major and minor release.

We hold public development meetings and chat in our Slack team (**[get an invite](http://shadowproject.herokuapp.com/)** and join **[our chat](https://shadowproject.slack.com/)**). We also maintain a public roadmap and dev blog to give you an idea of what's being worked on right now, and what's coming next.

We're currently looking for lead contributors in the following roles:

- Translations
- Documentation

**Do you know someone who might be interested? Do not hesitate and contact us directly.**

### Found a problem? Let us know!

If you think you've found a bug or a problem with Shadow, **[please let us know](https://shadowproject.io/bug-bounties)**! First, search our issue tracker to search to see if someone has already reported the problem. If they haven't, click here to open a new issue, and fill out the template with as much information as possible. The more you can tell us about the problem and how it occurred, the more likely we are to fix it. Please check out our bug and bounty program for our guidelines and more details.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities publicly.**

### Donate

We are a non-profit and Open Source software project and are trying to build a private economy. We appreciate all the help we can get in making this a reality. Both addresses are managed by Rynomster (lead developer). If applicable, please specify whether you want to remain anonymous. Many thanks to all our sponsors!
