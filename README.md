### Sass compiling via Gulp [NOT YET]

**Don't edit CSS directly!** This website is using Sass and all CSS changes will be discarded if edited directly. [Learn about Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) and [how to compile it to CSS automatically](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/).

If you don't want to mess with Gulp, just edit the Sass files and ask someone else to compile it (e.g. @AllienWorks)

Here's a short version (WIP, might not be correct):

- navigate to the Project in Terminal and type ```npm install gulp --save-dev``` (this will download all the modules and dependencies; you need this to run only the first time)
- then install Sass module via ```npm install gulp-sass --save-dev``` (also run just once)
- now all you need to do is start ```gulp``` - it will automatically watch for file changes and compile them immediately (let it run in terminal and try modifying some SCSS and save it)

(There _has_ to be even easier way, but I'm not aware of it ATM. If _you_ know, share pls)

Your terminal output should looks something like this: 

    user@machine:/var/www/html/shadow-website-testing$ gulp
